  # Fix RLS Policies for Admin Panel Book Upload

  This migration fixes the Row Level Security policies to allow
  authenticated users in the admin panel to upload books without
  strict ownership requirements.

  1. Remove restrictive policies
  2. Add permissive policies for authenticated users
  3. Ensure user profile creation
  4. Fix storage bucket policies
*/

-- 1. Drop all existing conflicting policies on books table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for authenticated users" ON books;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable insert for authenticated users" ON books;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update for book owners" ON books;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable delete for book owners" ON books;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable all operations for admins" ON books;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to insert books" ON books;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can read all books" ON books;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can insert books" ON books;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own books" ON books;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own books" ON books;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all books" ON books;

-- 2. Create simple, permissive policies for admin panel access
CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to read books" ON books
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to insert books" ON books
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to update books" ON books
  FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to delete books" ON books
  FOR DELETE TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- 3. Ensure all authenticated users have a profile
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.users (id, full_name, email, role)
  VALUES (
    new.id,
    COALESCE(new.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', new.email),
    new.email,
    CASE 
      WHEN new.email = 'admin@example.com' THEN 'admin'
      ELSE 'student'
    END
  )
  ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
    full_name = EXCLUDED.full_name,
    email = EXCLUDED.email,
    updated_at = NOW();
  RETURN new;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- 4. Create trigger to automatically create user profiles
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE public.handle_new_user();

-- 5. Fix storage policies to be more permissive
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable upload for authenticated users" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for authenticated users" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update for file owners" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable delete for file owners" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable all operations for admins on storage" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can upload books" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own book files" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own book files" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view book files" ON storage.objects;

-- Create permissive storage policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload files" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'books');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read files" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'books');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update files" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'books')
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'books');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete files" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'books');

-- Allow public read access for book files (so they can be viewed)
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to book files" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT TO public
  USING (bucket_id = 'books');

-- 6. Ensure books bucket exists and is properly configured
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'books',
  'books',
  true,
  209715200, -- 200MB limit
  ARRAY['application/pdf']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  public = EXCLUDED.public,
  file_size_limit = EXCLUDED.file_size_limit,
  allowed_mime_types = EXCLUDED.allowed_mime_types;
